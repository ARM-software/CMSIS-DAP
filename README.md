# CMSIS-DAP

The branch *main* of this GitHub repository contains  **CMSIS-DAP** - a protocol specification and a firmware implementation that enables standardized access to Arm CoreSight Debug Access Port ([DAP](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102585/0000/what-is-a-debug-access-port)) for debugging embedded software programs.

The figure below illustrates the concept:
