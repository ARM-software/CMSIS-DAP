# Overview {#mainpage}

Many Arm Cortex processors implement CoreSight Debug Access Port ([DAP](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102585/0000/what-is-a-debug-access-port)) that equips them with powerful on-chip debug and trace capabilities. **CMSIS-DAP** standardizes and simplifies access to this functionalilty for embedded software developers.

**CMSIS-DAP** is a protocol specification and a firmware implementation that enables standardized communication between two sides:

 - On one side an Arm Cortex-based processor where an embedded application is executed,
 - and on the other side a software debug tool that runs on a host computer.

CMSIS-DAP support can be implemented in a standalone debug unit, or also as a component integrated on a development board. The figure below illustrates the concept:

![CMSIS-DAP Interface](./images/CMSIS_DAP_INTERFACE.png)

Connection with the target processor is possible over the physical interfaces supported by the CoreSight DAP: a 5-pin JTAG or a 2-pin Serial Wired Debug (SWD) interface. Additionally it can expose access to a UART for serial-to-USB communication. CMSIS-DAP supports target devices that contain one or more Arm Cortex cores.

For communication with the debugging program the USB connection is used. A broad set of \ref DAP_Commands_gr enables uniform support for CMSIS-DAP independendent on the actual probe.

The \ref dap_firmware provides a template implementation of the CMSIS-DAP concept as well as several example projects for popular debug units.

Debug probes can be validated for compliance to CMSIS-DAP using the scripts explained in \ref dap_validate.

> **Note**
> - CMSIS-DAP v1.x is \a deprecated and is not recommended for new designs.
> - Use \ref dap_firmware "CMSIS-DAP v2.x" instead that provides high-speed SWO trace streaming and does not require driver installation in modern operating systems (Mac OS, Linux, Windows). Refer to \ref dap_drv_install for more information.

## Features and Benefits {#dap_benefits}

 - Provides a standardized interface for debuggers. Interfaces to many standard debuggers is available.
 - Access to CoreSight registers of all Cortex processor architectures (Cortex-A/R/M).
 - Connects via 5-pin JTAG or 2-pin Serial Wire Debug (SWD).
 - Supports multi-core debugging.
 - Supports Serial Wire Output (SWO) of Cortex-M devices.
 - Easy to deploy to debug units based on Cortex-M microcontrollers.
 - Debug unit may be integrated on an evaluation board.
 - Using USB bulk transfers avoids driver installation on host PC.
 - Supports time-critical JTAG or SWD command execution.
 - Supports Test Domain Timer for time measurement using the debug unit.
 - Supports UART communication port, which can be routed to USB COM Port (optional) or native CMSIS-DAP commands (new in CMSIS-DAP Version 2.1.0).
 - Flexible customization is possible with vendor-specific commands.
